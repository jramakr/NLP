## Natural Language Processing with NLTK and Python

### Simple Text Processing with NLTK :
Covers a variety of text processing tasks such as extracting Words, Sentences, Parts of Speech tagging, Stop Words, Stemming, Lemmatization 
and Regex parsing of documents from the NLTK corpus.

### Sentiment Analysis using NLTK and GB Classifier:
With the rise of online social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Reddit, and the proliferation of customer reviews on 
sites like Amazon and Yelp, we now have access, more than ever before, to massive text-based data sets! They can be analyzed in order 
to determine how large portions of the population feel about certain products, events, etc. 
This sort of analysis is called sentiment analysis, and the notebook builds one from scratch.
